subtitle: A brief summary of my footsteps

My scientific journey has been driven by a fascination with **interfaces**—where chemistry meets physics. From synthesizing atomic-scale catalysts to diagnosing failure in industrial batteries, I strive to bridge fundamental physical principles with practical engineering challenges. My goal is to use this cross-disciplinary intuition to decode complex electrochemical behaviors.

## I. Industrial Physics & Data-Driven Diagnostics

### **Tianneng Battery**
*July 2024 - Present | Failure Analysis Engineer / Advanced Electrochemical Engineer*

**The Challenge:** How do we translate microscopic degradation mechanisms into macroscopic safety and performance descriptors?

*   **Deconvoluting Impedance (DRT):** Standard EIS often blurs distinct electrochemical processes. I developed an automated **Distribution of Relaxation Times (DRT)** pipeline in Python. This allowed us to mathematically separate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) contribution from charge transfer and diffusion kinetics, providing a clearer picture of large cell aging.
*   **Physics-Informed Data Science:** Applied **Random Forest** algorithms to bridge the gap between raw material properties and cell-level performance, moving beyond trial-and-error to predictive engineering.
*   **Thermal Safety Mechanics:** Optimized **ARC (Accelerating Rate Calorimetry)** configurations to analyze heating rate models. The goal is not just to observe thermal runaway, but to identify the specific onset of exothermic reactions for safety diagnosis (Patent pending).
*   **Microstructure Quantifiction:** Established rigorous protocols for measuring **electrode tortuosity** and **SEM porosity**, linking geometric factors to transport limitations.

## II. Interfacial Dynamics & Spectro-electrochemistry

### **University of Texas at Austin**
*Sept. 2020 — Jan. 2024 | Graduate Research Assistant*

**The Inquiry:** How does the solvent environment—specifically the hydrogen bond network—dictate reaction kinetics beyond simple mass transport?

*   **Spectroscopic Evidence:** Utilized **ATR-SEIRAS** (Surface-Enhanced Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy) to directly observe the interfacial water structure during the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER).
*   **Kinetic Decoupling:** Conducted precise measurements using **ultra-microelectrodes (UMEs)** in DMSO-water cosolvents.
*   **Key Insight:** Discovered that H-bond competitors significantly disrupt the interfacial water structure. This disruption affects the proton donor capability, proving that HER kinetics are governed by local solvation structures, not just bulk properties.

### **University of Michigan, Ann Arbor**
*Jan. 2019 — July 2020 | Master Student (Mentored by Prof. Charles McCrory)*

**The Inquiry:** Which thiol leaves the surface first?

*   **The Mismatch:** Investigated the anomaly where the reductive desorption onset potential of Mixed Self-assembled Monolayers (SAMs) did not correlate linearly with surface coverage.
*   **Surface Quantification:** Synthesized a **Cl-terminated thiol** tag and utilized **XPS** to quantify the precise elemental composition before and after desorption.
*   **Mechanism Revealed:** Found that the discrepancy was driven by **phase separation** within the monolayer. The choice of solvent (Ethanol vs. Chloroform vs. DCM) during assembly fundamentally altered the domain formation, thereby changing the electrochemical stability.

## III. Material Synthesis and Study

### **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**
*July 2017 — Jan. 2018 | Research Intern (Mentored by Prof. Hong Yang)*

**The Strategy:** Manipulating lattice strain via lanthanide doping to enhance OER activity.

*   **Lattice Engineering:** Fabricated Pyrochlore-type Iridium catalysts. By doping with lanthanides of varying atomic radii, we induced specific lattice strains.
*   **Structure-Property Relationship:** Proposed a correlation between the **atomic number** (ionic radius) of the dopant and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) stability/activity in acidic media.

### **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**
*Nov. 2016 — July 2018 | Undergraduate Researcher (Mentored by Prof. Jianbo Wu)*

**The Discovery:** A polymer-mediated growth mechanism for 2D metals.

![](/img/2d.png)

*   **Synthesis:** Used a solvothermal method to grow 2D nanostructures of Pt-group and Fe-group metals using tungsten hexacarbonyl.
*   **Mechanism Proposal:** Uncovered that Pt catalyzes the reduction of ethylene glycol to form a polymer "net." This net restricts vertical growth, inducing the formation of high-surface-area 2D sheets.
*   **Outcome:** Published in [Advanced Functional Materials (2019)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adfm.201904278), demonstrating superior Methanol Oxidation Reaction (MOR) activity.

## Scientific Communication & Outreach

*   **Science Journalism**: As a trainee journalist for *Global Science* (Scientific American Chinese Edition), I practiced the art of translating complex chemistry breakthroughs into accessible narratives. [Sample Work](https://planetpolly.github.io/2019-01-27-Fermat-s-last-theorem/)
*   **Teaching**: As a Graduate Teaching Assistant for *Introduction to Biophysics* and *Spectroscopy*, I helped students visualize abstract physical concepts, reinforcing my own understanding of the fundamentals.
