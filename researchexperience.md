*I have conducted research in various fields including lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, biosensors, organic synthesis, and interface science. This variety of research experiences has given me a good intuition about combining knowledge from different subfields. This intuition helps me keep an open mind when I encounter complex physical and chemical problems.*

## Project Experience

### **Work 1 (Tianneng Battery)**
*July 2024 - Present*
*Failure Analysis Engineer / Advanced Electrochemical Engineer*

*   **EIS Analysis**: Developed an automated **DRT (Distribution of Relaxation Times)** pipeline using Python to separate SEI process, charge transfer, and diffusion kinetics.
*   **Electrode Characterization**: Established protocols for measuring **electrode tortuosity** and **SEM porosity**.
*   **Thermal Safety**: Optimized **ARC (Accelerating Rate Calorimetry)** configurations and analyzed heating rate models for safety diagnosis (Patent pending).
*   **Data Science**: Applied **Random Forest** to bridge raw material descriptors with cell-level electrochemical performance.
*   **Engineering Projects**: Led grid grain structure studies for lead-acid systems and participated in lab construction/LIMS implementation.

### **University of Texas at Austin**
*Sept. 2020 — Jan. 2024*
*Graduate Research Assistant*

**Project: Spectro-electrochemical study on the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)**

![](/img/3.png)

*   Utilized **ATR-SEIRAS** (infrared spectroscopy) to identify the hydrogen bond network at the electrode-electrolyte interface.
*   Conducted precise measurements of HER kinetics and mass transport in DMSO-water cosolvents using **ultra-microelectrodes (UMEs)**.
*   Found that H-bond competitors disrupt the interfacial water structure, which has a non-trivial impact on HER kinetics beyond simple mass transport.

### **University of Michigan, Ann Arbor**
*Jan. 2019 — July 2020*
*Master Student (Mentored by Prof. Charles McCrory)*

**Project: Reductive Desorption of Mixed Self-assembled Monolayers (SAMs)**

![](/img/msam.png)

*   Investigated the **mismatch** between desorption onset potential and surface coverage changes.
*   Synthesized **Cl-terminated thiol** and utilized **XPS** to quantify the elemental composition of SAMs before and after desorption.
*   Found that phase separation in mixed SAMs is strongly affected by the choice of solvent (Ethanol vs. Chloroform vs. DCM) during preparation.

### **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**
*July 2017 — Jan. 2018*
*Research Intern (Mentored by Prof. Hong Yang)*

**Project: Pyrochlore-Type Iridium Catalysts for OER**

<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/30/158530-050-3BB8C4C8/radii-coordination-number-metals-atomic.jpg?raw=true" width="500px">

*   Fabricated OER catalysts with low overpotential and improved stability in acidic conditions using **lanthanide doping** for lattice manipulation.
*   Proposed a relationship between the OER activity and the **atomic numbers** of the lanthanide dopants.

### **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**
*Nov. 2016 — July 2018*
*Undergraduate Researcher (Mentored by Prof. Jianbo Wu)*

**Project: Platinum-Based 2D Nanostructures for MOR**

**Publication**: [CHEN, W., MA, Y., LI, F., **PAN, L.** et al. Advanced Functional Materials 29, 1904278 (2019).](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/adfm.201904278)

![](/img/2d.png)

*   Synthesized 2D nanostructures of Pt-group and Fe-group metals utilizing tungsten hexacarbonyl as a reducing agent.
*   Proposed a **growth mechanism**: Pt catalyzes the reduction of ethylene glycol to form a polymer "net" that induces the lateral growth of the metal.
*   Obtained superior MOR (Methanol Oxidation Reaction) activity compared to conventional catalysts due to increased surface area and improved adsorption.

---

### **Other Research Training**

*   **Total Synthesis (2015-2016)**: Trained in the synthesis of spiro compounds using the semi-Pinacol rearrangement reaction.
*   **Fluorescent Probes (2015-2016)**: Prepared a probe for gluconate recognition and proposed a new fluorescence-quenching model.
