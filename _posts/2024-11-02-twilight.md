There is something transformational about twilight.
暮光可以改变。

When the sun has just set in the west, the sky changes from the vibrant blue of afternoon to a more relaxed hue, as if it’s settling down for the evening. Soon the east will darken even as the west goes through a riot of reds, oranges and yellows. And then, at last, the black of night will reign once again.

太阳西沉，天空的颜色从明亮的蓝色专为混合深蓝。东方变暗，地平线西方一片红光。然后，进入夜色。

There’s a poetry to it, a liminal feeling of being between two existences, that of night and day. The prefix “twi-” in Old English means “in two ways,” and certainly this twofold state of in-betwixt-ness has inspired its share of literary verse. Another term for twilight is “gloaming,” a word so rich in texture I can _feel_ it.

像诗一样，白天和黑夜交际的模糊感觉。twilight 中 “twi”在古英语中表示“in two ways”。另一个表示暮光的词是“gloaming”，它的组成也有丰富的含义。

But besides poetry, there is a science to twilight, too. Astronomers (among others who eagerly await the night) are so familiar with twilight that we’ve classified its various stages. If you haven’t spent much time gazing at the sky as the sun drifts below the horizon, then you’ve missed out on some wonderful visual treats.

除了文学的欣赏，暮光也可作为科学研究。天文学家研究暮光的各个阶段。如果没有在太阳落山之际好好观察天空，你会错过很多奇观。

First, let’s give it up for Earth’s atmosphere. Without air, we’d have some fairly serious problems—such as not being able to breathe—though given how turbulent and opaque it can be, some astronomers would rather do without it. But one interesting thing the atmosphere does is scatter sunlight: photons from the sun hit molecules of nitrogen and oxygen in the air and bounce off. Many of those photons wind up caroming toward the ground, so when we look up, we see the light coming from the sky itself.

首先，大气层消失。没有大气，会带来很多问题——比如不能呼吸——尽管会很混乱很麻烦，天文学家还是希望大气层消失。大气层会散射光线：太阳光子遇到空气中的氧气和氮气分子会碰撞改变方向。大部分光子转向地面，到达我们眼中，对我们来说，就是整片天空都是亮的。

At night, when the bulk of the solid Earth blocks the sun, there’s no sunlight to scatter, so the sky is dark, and, depending on weather, we can see what lies beyond. Between these two times lies the lair of twilight. But the gloaming doesn’t come all at once; instead twilight slides over the sky in eliding stages.

夜晚，地球自身遮挡太阳的光线，自然没有散射的光线，天空幽暗。在日夜交替的时候，我们看到暮光 twilight。但是，阴霾并不是一下子来临，相反，暮色在天空中滑过，渐行渐远。

The first that occurs after sunset is called civil twilight, so named because it’s when the sky is still bright enough for people to conduct typical “daytime” outdoor activities. By definition, civil twilight is the range in time when the sun is just below the horizon to when it’s six degrees lower (roughly the same span as three fingers held parallel in your outstretched hand).

首先出现的叫作 civil twilight, 它出现时，天空仍然很亮，人们能像白天一样在外面活动。civil twilight 出现的时间是太阳在地平线以下 0-6°的阶段。

The reason the early twilight sky is bright is because our planet is round. Our atmosphere curves along with Earth’s surface. To someone standing on the ground, the sun becomes invisible once it sets, but an observer at higher elevation—many kilometers up, for example—_can still see the sun_. From their loftier perspective, it hasn’t dropped below Earth’s edge yet. This means sunlight is still scattering off the air up there, offering a brief reprieve from the onrushing night.

此时天空仍然很亮，因为地球是圆的，太阳光被大气散射后仍能到达地面。如果站的够高，就能看到现在地平线下面的太阳。

Civil twilight’s duration varies from location to location and season to season. For very high latitudes, near the poles, the sun’s path across the sky takes our star below the horizon only at certain times of the year, and it’s not always low enough for the night to get truly dark. Twilight can last for many hours in these regions. Closer to the equator, the sun dives in a more perpendicular fashion toward the horizon, and civil twilight there lasts less than half an hour.

civil twilight的持续时间和地点有关，和季节有关。高纬度区域，极夜或者极昼发生，也就没有 civil twilight。而在这些区域一旦发生，暮光能持续数个小时。赤道附近，太阳几乎直射，civil twilight在这些区域往往不到半小时。

During civil twilight the brightest celestial objects may become visible if cloud cover or glare from artificial light sources doesn’t intervene. The moon can be seen in broad daylight but becomes easier to spot as the sky darkens. Venus and Jupiter can easily be bright enough to see toward the end of civil twilight—or earlier if you know exactly where to look.

天气好，城市光污染不严重的话，civil twilight期间可以看到比较亮的星星。月亮可见，天越黑越明显。金星和木星也能在civil twilight 期间看到。


This is also when you’re likely to see the most colors in the sky toward the west. Those same molecules that scatter sunlight don’t do so randomly; the angle of scattering depends on the color of the light. Blue light is scattered much more than red, which is why the sky is blue during the day. Red light, however, tends to stream right past those molecules. So at dusk, all the blue light from the sun is scattered away, leaving only the redder colors to shine through, creating those gasp-worthy polychromatic sunsets.

西边的天空呈现出一天中最多的颜色。散射光的强度和光的颜色有关。蓝光的散射比红光强，所以白天天空是蓝的。红光更多是直射穿过空气分子，不改变方向。黄昏时，蓝光被散射走了，只有红光可见，形成了日落时丰富的色彩。

Still, the darkening inexorably continues. The next phase is nautical twilight, when the sun is between six and 12 degrees below the horizon. The sky may be a deep purple, and stars begin to appear. The term “nautical twilight” came about because sailors used the stars to get their bearings, and it’s at this time of the early evening that celestial navigation becomes possible.

黑暗仍在降临。接下来是 nautical twilight，发生在太阳低于地平线6-12°时。天空是深紫色，显现出很多星星。“nautical twilight”的名称来自利用星星的水手们，因为nautical twilight出现时，就能用星星导航。

After that comes astronomical twilight. This is when the sun is 12 to 18 degrees below the horizon and the sky finally appears black, with the stars truly shining. We call it astronomical twilight because it may look dark to your eye, but through a telescope, the sky is still bright enough to interfere with some observations. This last phase of twilight concludes once the sun drops below 18 degrees; the sky becomes fully dark, and astronomers can enjoy the beginning of their work night.

之后是astronomical twilight。太阳在地平线下12-18°。天空完全变黑，星星闪耀。它的命名是因为即使眼睛观察不到什么，用望远镜仍能看到明亮的天空。这一阶段结束标志着，太阳已经低于地平线18°，天空完全变黑，天文学家可以干活了。

Of course, this is all for dusk, after sunset. The process happens in reverse order at dawn, when the sun _rises_. I remember many a telescopic observing session running all night long; I could always tell when the sky would just start to brighten, signaling the time to close up shop, back up my data and head home for a good morning’s sleep. Being up from dusk till dawn was my way of life.

以上是黄昏，黎明时则会重演，倒着重演一遍这个过程。经过一晚上的天文观测，我能感知天什么时候要亮了，该停止观测，备份数据，回去睡觉了。从傍晚到黎明，这是我的生活。

That isn’t to say that sunset and sunrise are perfectly symmetric—they’re different! The dawn sky tends to be clearer and cleaner than dusk. That’s because during the day, light from the sun, especially ultraviolet light, interacts with molecules in Earth’s air to boost levels of aerosols, particles that float high in the atmosphere. These tend to scatter light differently, giving the sky a whitish, hazy appearance. This is usually more obvious in summer, when circulation patterns are lazier and the haze can stick around longer.

日出和日落不是可逆的两个过程。它们不同。黎明天空比黄昏更干净。白天，强烈的紫外线与空气相互作用会产生一些气溶胶，光线的散射被改变，视觉上天空看起来更白更不透明。夏天会更明显，当空气流动没那么活跃，模糊雾状的感觉会持续更久。

Still, I have always loved twilight at dusk. The world quietens, and the sky itself heralds the coming of the stars. For an astronomer, twilight signals a welcoming to the universe, and the anticipation of that is one of the best things I know.

我喜欢暮光。世界很安静，天空预示着星星的到来。天文学上，暮光像是宇宙发来的邀请，会带来最令人期待的惊喜。
