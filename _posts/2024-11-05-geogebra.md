Quadrilateral ABCD has angles 
$$\angle{BAC}=80^{\circ}$$
,
$$\angle{CAD}=20^{\circ}$$
,
$$\angle{BDA}=50^{\circ}$$
, and 
$$\angle{CDB}=50^{\circ}$$
. Find angles
$$\angle{BCA},  \angle{CBD}$$

Add a point E on line CD such that
$$BE \parallel AD$$

It's straightforward to establish that AB=DE, and that segment AE serves as the angle bisector, similar to segment BD. Consequently, we find that AC=CE, AB=BE=DE, then, 
$$BC \perp AE, \angle BCA=60^{\circ}, \angle CBD=10^{\circ}$$
