Quadrilateral ABCD has angles 
$$\angle{BAC}=80^{\circ}$$
,
$$\angle{CAD}=20^{\circ}$$
,
$$\angle{BDA}=50^{\circ}$$
, and 
$$\angle{CDB}=50^{\circ}$$
. Find angles
$$\angle{BCA},  \angle{CBD}$$

Add a point E on line CD such that \( BE \) is parallel to \( AD \).

It's straightforward to establish that \( AB = DE \), and that segment AE serves as the angle bisector, similar to segment BD. Consequently, we find that  \( AC = CE \), and \( AB = BE = DE \). Therefore, we can conclude that \( BC \) is perpendicular to \( AE \), with \( \angle BCA = 60^{\circ} \) and \( \angle CBD = 10^{\circ} \).
