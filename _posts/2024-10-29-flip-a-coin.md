This is a question from the book *The Green-Eyed Dragons and Other Mathematical Monsters*

(a) Consider the following game. You flip a coin until you get a tails. The number of dollars you win equals the number og coins you end up flipping. (So if you immediately get a tails, you win one dollar; if you get one heads before a tails, you win two dollars, etc.) What is the expectation value of your winnings?
